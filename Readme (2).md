**A Multimodal Dataset for AUV Propeller Entanglement Fault Diagnosis**

This is a synchronized multimodal dataset developed for the fault diagnosis of propeller entanglement in Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). The dataset is designed to support and validate advanced fault diagnosis algorithms that fuse optical images with electrical signals, with a particular emphasis on studying algorithmic robustness under simulated, degraded underwater visual conditions.

**Data Modalities:**

- **Visual Data (Optical Images):** Sequences of frontal-view underwater color images of the thruster, captured at a resolution of 224x224 pixels and a frame rate of 15 fps.
- **Electrical Data (Electrical Signals):** Multivariate time-series signals from the thruster's motor, acquired synchronously with the visual data. These signals include current, voltage, rotational speed, and motor duty cycle (%), sampled at a frequency of 50 Hz.

**Availability:**

The dataset will be released publicly upon the acceptance of the associated research paper. Please stay tuned for updates.
